#[Multi-1v1] Challenge
by Michael Flaherty (C) 2016

##About:
This plugin is an extension to splewis's Multi-1v1 arenas plugin linked below. This plugin
allows players who are in game to challenge their friends and get paired together in order to battle
for either credits or fun. It allows for functionality to hook into Zephyrus's store and is very
customizable to a server owner's needs.

##Backstory:
When I first started getting interested into SourceMod scripting I was in charge of a little 1v1 arenas server. My goal with SourceMod was to eventually be able to make this plugin, and here we are. Looking back to where I started I've learned plenty about programming and the SourceMod community has shaped my future in a way to where I am now studying Computer Engineering in college. Special thanks to the SourceMod development team and Splewis!

##Installation:
